# The Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (NIRAMS II)

NIRAMS II is a simple, spatially distributed nitrate leaching model designed to estimate nitrate loadings to groundwater from the base of the soil profile. 
The model was developed by the [James Hutton Institute](https://www.hutton.ac.uk/) and has been used to support the Scottish Government's reviews of the [Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ)](https://www.gov.scot/policies/agriculture-and-the-environment/nvz/) in line with the EU Nitrates Directive.

## Requirements

  * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
  * [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [H5py](http://www.h5py.org/)
  * [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)

If you're installing from scratch on Windows then I thoroughly recommend the [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/) installation.

## Documentation

Background to the model's development, its uses and some basic documentation are provided [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JamesSample/nirams_ii/blob/master/nirams_ii_notes.ipynb).

## Previous applications

A report detailing how NIRAMS II was used to support the 2013 review of the Nitrates Directive in Scotland is available
